# Next.js redux starter
An opinionated Next.js starter kit with Express, Redux, styled-components, and react-testing-library.

## About
Next.js is an awesome and minimalistic framework to make a modern universal react app. However, there're times that we need a bit more features to build a complex SPA. That's why this project is born.

## Getting started
```
cd my-project
yarn install
yarn start
```

Then open `http://localhost:3100/` to see your app.

### Deployment
After `npm run build` finished, run

```
yarn serve
```

If you prefer using `now`, just modify `now.json` config.
